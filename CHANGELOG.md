# Changelog

## 0.3.0 — unreleased

- Decouple logical proposal batches from workers with `--batch-size`; defaults preserve
  the 0.1.x adaptive sequence and existing trial values.
- Add opt-in deterministic fixed-lag pipelining with `--batch-lag 1`, plus timing-only
  `--scheduler-stats` diagnostics.
- Add opt-in median and successive-halving prefix pruning with frozen earlier-batch cuts,
  partial `pruned` trial metrics, and cumulative compute counters.
- Share the existing compiled artifact, plugin, dataset, and compiled expressions for the
  entire study; reuse worker threads and serialize inputs once per trial across rungs.
- Forward batching/pruning settings from StudySpec and retain 0.2.0 progress, stop,
  symbol-info, recorded metrics, magnifier metering, and trial-timeout contracts.
- Add worker-count replay, lag, pruning, default-compatibility, and prefix API regressions;
  publish paired real-strategy measurements and replay methodology.

## 0.2.0 — unreleased

- U1: native `--syminfo FILE` applies optional mintick, pointvalue, exchange
  timezone, and session after inputs and overrides, in release-harness order.
  Flat and wrapped JSON are accepted; instrument numbers must be finite and
  positive, strings must be NUL-free, and omitted/empty string values keep defaults.
- U2: native `--progress-fd N` emits one flushed terminal-trial JSONL object through
  one writer, matching final `trials[]` entries. Non-blocking descriptors wait for
  writability on temporary backpressure. Consumers must drain pipes.
- U3: SIGTERM/SIGINT and native `--max-wall-seconds S` stop worker claims and
  adaptive batches cooperatively, including grid/random mid-batch. Final JSON
  includes completed trials and `stop_reason: cancelled` or `deadline`.
  Signal handlers restart interrupted blocking I/O, including final result writes.
- U4: repeatable native `--record-metric PATH` validates and retains additional
  report metrics under their expression names; unavailable values are `null`.
- U5: every trial `backtest` now includes `magnifier_sample_ticks_total`.
- U6: CMake supports installed engine prefixes, locating generated `version.h`
  under both `include/` and `build/include/`.
- U8: native `--trial-timeout-seconds T` records one `trial_timeout`, emits final
  JSON from terminal trials with `stop_reason: trial_timeout`, and `_exit(3)`
  without joining hung workers. The watchdog remains active if progress I/O fails.
  The study aborts rather than changing worker count.
- U9: public `pineforge_hpo.prepare_run(study_path, engine_root, cache_dir)` returns
  native argv and artifact JSON without launching, reusing CLI preparation.
- Existing trial statuses remain `ok`, `constraint_violation`, `objective_error`,
  `constraint_error`, `engine_error`, and `trial_error`. Existing stop reasons remain
  `trial_budget_reached`, `search_space_exhausted`, and `sampler_stopped`.
- Exit codes 0 (best feasible), 1 (initialization/I/O error), and 2 (no feasible
  trial) are unchanged; 3 denotes a trial timeout even with an earlier best trial.
  Cooperative stops and timeouts publish final JSON when result destinations remain
  writable, including empty tables for cooperative stops. Permanent progress I/O
  failures publish completed trials before exit 1; initialization or result-output
  failures may prevent publication.
- Add separate ASan/UBSan and TSan CMake presets and native-process contract tests.
  With no new flags, existing result fields and scoring/proposals remain unchanged
  except for the product version and the additive magnifier counter. No Python
  signal/progress/wall-limit forwarding or StudySpec timeout fields are added.

## 0.1.0

- Initial native single-strategy runner, artifact bridge, metric expressions,
  grid/random/TPE/dlib samplers, and finite candidate policies.
